# CovidByCounty
- Animated map of COVID-19 in all U.S. counties.

## What is this?
***
This is the code repository for the web site hosted at [https://www.unboxedmind.com/covidbycounty/](https://www.unboxedmind.com/covidbycounty/)

This site displays an animated cloropleth map of COVID-19 data by county across the United States. It can be customized to show numerous different measures of the data, both absolute and per capita, and measuring either cumulative totals or changes over a customizable time period.

The COVID-19 case data displayed is assembled from a data set built and made public by the New York Times, and population data is from the U.S. Census Bureau. For more information, please see the site itself as linked above.
