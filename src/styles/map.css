/*
* Below are Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) definitions in use in this file,
* which allow easily changing how counties are displayed.
*
*
* For the U.S. Census county codes (FIPS codes) used in this file to identify individual counties, see this link:
* https://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/reference/codes/files/national_county.txt
*
* The county codes used in this file combine the 2-digit state code, which is in the second column of the file
* linked above, and the 3-digit county code, which is in the third column of the file linked above. Each value
* for the "id" attribute for each county is in the following form: "c[state_code][county-code]". For example,
* for Loving Country in Texas, the state code is "48" and the county code is "301", so the id name for the
* county is "c48301".
*
* County codes used in this file can also be found on Wikimedia Commons at this link:
* https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File_talk:Usa_counties_large.svg/county_codes
*
* Examples:
*
* To color two counties red (in this case Loving County and Dallas County in Texas) simply
* go to the CSS insertion point and add:
*
* #c48301, #c48113 {fill:red}
*
* To color an entire state's counties (in the case New Mexico, with "35" being the state code) a green,
* go to the CSS insertion point and add:
*
* path[id*='c35'] {fill:#34A853}
*
